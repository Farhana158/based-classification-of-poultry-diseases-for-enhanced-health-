### Introduction
- Title Slide: "Transfer Learning Based Classification of Poultry Diseases"
- Brief overview of poultry diseases and importance of early detection
- Thesis statement: Transfer learning can be effectively used for classification of poultry diseases, enhancing health management

### Poultry Diseases Overview
- *Common Poultry Diseases*
    - Viral diseases: Marek's disease, Newcastle disease, Infectious bronchitis
    - Bacterial diseases: Pullorum, Fowl cholera, Coryza
    - Parasitic diseases: Coccidiosis

### Transfer Learning
- *What is Transfer Learning?*
    - A machine learning technique where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned for a specific task
    - Enables leveraging of pre-trained models for new tasks
- *Benefits*
    - Reduced training time and data requirements
    - Improved model performance

### Methodology
- *Dataset Collection*
    - Images of poultry diseases
- *Pre-trained Model Selection*
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT)
- *Fine-Tuning*
    - Adjusting model weights for poultry disease classification

### Model Performance
- *Metrics*
    - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- *Results*
    - High accuracy rates achieved using transfer learning

### Conclusion
- Summary of key points
- Future work: expanding dataset, exploring other pre-trained models
